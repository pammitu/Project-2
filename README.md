## About the Project
<hr style="border: 1px solid #ccc">

Book Club is a full-stack web application which allows users to browse, and review books. Each user has the ability to read, create and delete both book reviews and notable quotes from the book of their choice. Book Club was designed so that readers can have a community where they can log and keep track of the books they read while also interacting with other user's to share or discuss differing opinion.

The images below show how we designed our application, we had some trouble trying to choose an optimal style for users but we decided to go with the most user friendly and simple set-up.

A user will be able to start on the home page with the index of current books on the website. From there they can choose a book they are interested in learning about or a book that they have already read. Once they click on the book cover they are interested in they will be redirected to another page where they can see the  Title, Author, and Summary of the book. There may be some reviews and notable quotes already on the page if the book has been there for a while and they can choose to add, edit or delete the reviews and notable quotes.
